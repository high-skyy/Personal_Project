# Port Forwarding
Allows computers or services in private networks to connect over the internet with other public or private computers or services.

## Explanation
A "private LAN" could be your home Wi-Fi, etc.
It typically requires a PW ro some form of authentication to connect.
Once connected, your device - labtop, cell phone, etc. is assigned an IP address on the network through a process called DHCP.
Your device is the host or source for the connection.
The router then reads the request and maps your device's IP address and port.

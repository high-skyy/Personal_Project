# DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks.
  - Thus allowing them to use network services such as DNS, NTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP
-**A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network**
  - So they can communicate with other IP networks
> DHCP는 자동적으로 IP 주소와 여러 network configuration을 자동으로 할당 해준다.
- Configuration : the arrangement or set-up of the HW and SW that make up a computer system.
